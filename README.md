# Project Name: Space Dodge 
This Python project serves as an introduction to the Pygame library. Designed with simplicity in mind, it offers a foundation for understanding Pygame's core functionalities.  As a first project using Pygame, it prioritizes clear logic over simple visuals. This focus allows for a smooth learning curve. Future iterations may incorporate more advanced features and aesthetics.
